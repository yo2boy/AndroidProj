Arduino LED Pattern
====================

This is an Android Application that communicates with an Arduino Uno through a USB-OTG Cable connected to the board.

The application presents the user with 12 LED switches that can be toggled individually or all at once, and the results are outputted on actual LEDs. 

Furthermore, I have provided 5 patterns which can be executed by either entering the name or by tapping "Next Pattern" which cycles through all the patterns consecutively.
